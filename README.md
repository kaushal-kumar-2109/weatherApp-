Project Description

#Objective: 
=> In this project, you will create a web-based weather application that allows users to enter a location and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location. The app should display details such as temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the current weather.
# Skills to Practice:

●	HTML for structuring the app.
●	CSS for styling and layout.
●	JavaScript for fetching weather data and interactivity.
●	Integrating with a public weather API.

#Project Requirements

=> Your weather app should include the following features:
 	User Input: Provide a text input field where users can enter the name of a city or location for which they want to check the weather.
 	Submit Button: Include a "Submit" button that, when clicked, triggers the weather data retrieval.
 	Display Weather Data: After a user submits a location, display the current weather conditions for that location. This should include temperature (in Celsius), weather description (e.g., "Sunny," "Cloudy," "Rainy"), and an icon representing the current weather condition.
 	Styling: Apply CSS to make your weather app visually appealing. Ensure it's responsive and user-friendly.
 	Use of Public Weather API: You are required to use a public weather API to fetch weather data for the entered location. One popular option is the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/), which provides a free tier.
 	Error Handling: Implement error handling in case the user enters an invalid location or if there are issues with the API request. Provide appropriate error messages to the user.
